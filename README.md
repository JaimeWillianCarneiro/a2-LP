# Scooby Doo e o Mistério Contra Ataca
Repositorio com A2 de Linguagens de Programação

## Introduction
This game is our work for the second evaluation in the Programming Languages subject, lectioned at the second semester of the course Data Science in FGV - EMAp.

During the second part of the PL course, we learnt about Object Oriented Programing concepts, in parallel with applying them to Python programs. This work aims to show the concepts we learnt so far (like encapsulation and inheritance) applied in a game, developed entirely by us.
